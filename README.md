I applied matrix factorization methods to make a personalized recommendation system for women using a <a href="http://www.occamslab.com/petricek/data/">ratings dataset</a> from the dating website <a href="http://www.libimseti.cz/">LibimSeTi.cz</a>.

When compared with the  “highest average rating” recommender system, the personalized recommender system reduced the fraction of suboptimal recommendations by an average of ~3% across users, and by as much as 7% for users who rated large numbers of profiles.

On online dating websites, users with highest average ratings are in high demand. Users with profiles that are recommended by a personalized recommender system are less likely to be overwhelmed by suitors, and so more likely to reciprocate interest from a suitor.  So a personalized recommender system would increase the fraction of suitable matches achieved more than the numbers above suggest.
