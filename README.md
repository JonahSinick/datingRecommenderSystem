I applied matrix factorization methods to make a personalized recommendation system for women using a <a href="http://www.occamslab.com/petricek/data/">ratings dataset</a> from the dating website <a href="http://www.libimseti.cz/">LibimSeTi.cz</a>.

When compared with the  "highest average rating" recommender system, the personalized recommender system reduced the fraction of suboptimal recommendations by an average of ~3% across users, and by as much as ~7% for users who rated large numbers of profiles.

On online dating websites, the demand for users with highest average ratings far outstrips supply for them. By way of contrast, users with profiles that are recommended by a personalized recommender system are less likely to be overwhelmed by suitors, and so more likely to reciprocate interest. Thus, in practice, the personalized recommender system would increase the fraction of suitable <strong>matches</strong> more than the numbers above suggest.
